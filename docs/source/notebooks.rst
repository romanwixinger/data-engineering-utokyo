Notebooks
=========

The following notebooks contain demonstrations on how to use the code and also
some of the real analyses performed for the research.


Recorder Demo
-------------
Notebook to demonstrate how to use the Recorder classes.


SSD Analysis Demo
-----------------

Notebook to demonstrate the SSD Analysis.


Beamtime Analsis
----------------

Analysis of the image data from the beamtime from the 18-19. September 2022.
In this analysis we fit the MOT number with the images taken with the CMOS camera.
The result is plotted as a function of time.


Beamtime SSD Analysis
---------------------

Analysis of the SSD data from the beamtime from the 18-19. September 2022.
In this analysis we look for peaks in the pulse rate.


CMOS Exploration
----------------

First test of the ImageAnalysis with data from the CMOS camera.


Laser Room Analysis
-------------------

Estimation of the MOT lifetime of Rb in the Laser room. Uses the ImageAnalysis
applied on CMOS camera images.


Source Union
------------

Notebook for unifying all data sources into a single table. The idea was to
see correlations between the data points, but this turned out to be harder than
anticipated.


Data Exploration
----------------

Original implementation of the Recorder classes. Loads and visualizes the different
files.


Result Exploration
------------------

Original notebook to explore the results of the analyses.
