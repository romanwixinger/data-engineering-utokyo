"],"metadata":{"id":"P1FA_lv6khE_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Overview\n","\n","### Problem\n","When we look at the data sources like the SSD or the CMOS images separately, then we find many promising hints for the MOT signal, but we cannot know if it is really the Francium MOT signal. Reconstructing each potential signal with the other data would be too time consuming. \n","\n","\n","### Idea\n","We slice the time into intervals and display all relevant sources in a single timeseries plot. When we see a potential Fr MOT signal, then we can directly cross-check the other signals for verification. \n","\n","### Relevant sources\n","We will consider the following sources: \n","- Neutralizer heater\n","- SSD1\n","- SSD2\n","- MOT coil\n","- CMOS images\n","- Wavemeter\n","- Linear manipulator position (if available)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uyYytwD4k2TD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data sources\n","As the amount of data is 1) big for pandas 2) distributed across many files, we have to find a schema on how to process the data. For this, we consider how the data from each source is distributed accross files. \n","\n","### Heater\n","The heater log of the neutralizer heater is stored as one file per day. It contains a timestamp, a duration, a voltage and a power. In theory, we can just mark the heating as a vertical line at the timestamp. We can use the heater information to query the data: If there is no heating, the data is not interesting. \n","\n","### SSD1 and SSD2\n","The SSD data is distributed across many files of varying size, each covering one of the non-overlapping timespans. In the SSDAnalysis we combine these files, convert the pulses into a pulse rate, and finds the peaks. In a first step, it would be possible to just work with these peaks or a sub-sampling of the pulse rate. The data is at WEDATA/data/ in files names like -20220919-193809-Slot3-In1.csv. The meaning of the different slots is: \n","- SSD1: Comes from the Ion beam irradiation on the Yttrium, so we can use it to cross-check the position of the rod.\n","- SSD2: Tells us whether the Fr was released during the heating.\n","- SSD2, Slot 2 ln 1: This is the PMT (photomultiplier tube) signal. Here we want to see peaks when we heat the Yttrium and release the Fr. \n","\n","### MOT coil\n","The status of the MOT coil is distributed across the parent folders of the CMOS images. We can find them in the folder mot_data/20220918-143000/ as all_data.csv. In this log files, we also have the region of interest (ROI) sum. In the ImageAnalysis, all these files are combined and enriched with the fitting result of the CMOS images. Thus, we can deal with this source as just one file. \n","\n","### CMOS images\n","The images are distributed across folders, one for each run. With the ImageAnalysis, we can convert the image to a result table, that contains per image: \n","- timestamp \n","- coil status\n","- ROI sum\n","- fitting results\n","The images are saved in the folder mot_data/20220918-143000/cmos_roidata/0917141341/ as cmos_000001.csv.  \n","\n","### Wavemeter\n","Could not find the data. \n","\n","### Linear manipulator position\n","Could not find the data."],"metadata":{"id":"2TVyCuwH37Zs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"N-0FcZDO_dxo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","filepath_drive = \"/content/drive/.shortcut-targets-by-id/1B48ps8379Krem2Eym3IJNaUK-_pZ9Q2w/NP2012-AVF72-05\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e63yZS33_z4s","outputId":"64ca48df-8a7f-40aa-b252-bf672fa9e87e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667904767100,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":29568,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["cd /content/drive/MyDrive/data-engineering-utokyo/notebooks"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N4t9CCKx__L5","outputId":"3979da4c-b5db-4657-debb-fd02ca0805af","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667904767101,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/data-engineering-utokyo/notebooks\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Update path\n","import sys\n","sys.path.insert(0,'..')"],"metadata":{"id":"BkRWXuwPAC-v","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667904767102,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Standard \n","from datetime import datetime\n","import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"metadata":{"id":"wL_1gOjgAIU-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667904768132,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1036,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Recorders\n","from src.recorders.heat_time_recorder import HeatTimeRecorder\n","from src.recorders.ssd_recorder import SSDRecorder\n","from src.recorders.file_recorder import FileRecorder\n","\n","# Analyses\n","from src.analyses.ssd_analysis import SSDAnalysis"],"metadata":{"id":"tcmg2L1_ALIQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667904772504,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4376,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data loading"],"metadata":{"id":"9sgBupvR_hcn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Heater\n","The heat time log allows us to find the interesting intervals, namely [time-2min, time+2min] for the time of the heating.
