Reconstructing each potential signal with the other data would be too time consuming. \n","\n","\n","### Idea\n","We slice the time into intervals and display all relevant sources in a single timeseries plot. When we see a potential Fr MOT signal, then we can directly cross-check the other signals for verification. \n","\n","### Relevant sources\n","We will consider the following sources: \n","- Neutralizer heater\n","- SSD1\n","- SSD2\n","- MOT coil\n","- CMOS images\n","- Wavemeter\n","- Linear manipulator position (if available)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uyYytwD4k2TD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data sources\n","As the amount of data is 1) big for pandas 2) distributed across many files, we have to find a schema on how to process the data. For this, we consider how the data from each source is distributed accross files. \n","\n","### Heater\n","The heater log of the neutralizer heater is stored as one file per day. It contains a timestamp, a duration, a voltage and a power. In theory, we can just mark the heating as a vertical line at the timestamp.\n","\n","### SSD1 and SSD2\n","The SSD data is distributed across many files of varying size, each covering one of the non-overlapping timespans. In the SSDAnalysis we combine these files, convert the pulses into a pulse rate, and finds the peaks. In a first step, it would be possible to just work with these peaks or a sub-sampling of the pulse rate. The data is at WEDATA/data/ in files names like -20220919-193809-Slot3-In1.csv. \n","\n","### MOT coil\n","The status of the MOT coil is distributed across the parent folders of the CMOS images. We can find them in the folder mot_data/20220918-143000/ as all_data.csv. In this log files, we also have the region of interest (ROI) sum. In the ImageAnalysis, all these files are combined and enriched with the fitting result of the CMOS images. Thus, we can deal with this source as just one file. \n","\n","### CMOS images\n","The images are distributed across folders, one for each run. With the ImageAnalysis, we can convert the image to a result table, that contains per image: \n","- timestamp \n","- coil status\n","- ROI sum\n","- fitting results\n","The images are saved in the folder mot_data/20220918-143000/cmos_roidata/0917141341/ as cmos_000001.csv.  \n","\n","### Wavemeter\n","Could not find the data. \n","\n","### Linear manipulator position\n","Could not find the data."],"metadata":{"id":"2TVyCuwH37Zs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"N-0FcZDO_dxo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","filepath_drive = \"/content/drive/.shortcut-targets-by-id/1B48ps8379Krem2Eym3IJNaUK-_pZ9Q2w/NP2012-AVF72-05\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e63yZS33_z4s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667897323107,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":19951,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}},"outputId":"9f845d28-7bea-4fe6-fc0e-9bc717383a46"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["cd /content/drive/MyDrive/data-engineering-utokyo/notebooks"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N4t9CCKx__L5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1667897323109,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Wixinger","userId":"01473319094776100629"}},"outputId":"98d7878d-4580-468b-902a-e0b0eaf0099c"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/data-engineering-utokyo/notebooks\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Update path\n","import sys\n","sys.path.insert(0,'..')"],"metadata":{"id":"BkRWXuwPAC-v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Standard \n","from datetime import datetime\n","import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"metadata":{"id":"wL_1gOjgAIU-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Recorders\n","from src.recorders.heater_recorder import HeaterRecorder\n","from src.recorders.ssd_recorder import SSDRecorder\n","from src.recorders.file_recorder import FileRecorder\n","\n","# Analyses\n","from src.analyses.ssd_analysis import SSDAnalysis"],"metadata":{"id":"tcmg2L1_ALIQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data loading"],"metadata":{"id":"9sgBupvR_hcn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"4eeq6KIalzxC"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"XIYNTLrWkXOD"},"outputs":[],"source":["!git status"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"N5EyxEKBbROW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
